## Project INFO: Our Challenges and Missions
We meet a lot of people every day. 
We meet people at schools. 
We meet people at work. 
We meet people at parties.

>The majority of the people becomes our acquaintances./ 
>We say hello to them when we occasionally bump into each other./
>But how much do we actually know about them?

###Problem Space
