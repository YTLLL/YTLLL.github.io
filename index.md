# Welcome to Project StoryBond

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/YTLLL/YTLLL.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

_Everyone is a book filled with their own life stories._

## Project INFO: Our Challenges and Missions
We meet a lot of people every day. 
We meet people at schools. 
We meet people at work. 
We meet people at parties.

>The majority of the people becomes our acquaintances. 
>We say hello to them when we occasionally bump into each other. 
>But how much do we actually know about them?

###Problem Space
How might people and their acquaintances know more about each other so that they can form genuine friendships?

###Our Goal
**We are building the platform that encourage people to share and exchange their stories. And these stories has the power to turn an acquaintances into friends, to form bonds, to discover each other.
