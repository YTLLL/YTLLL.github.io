Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Our Challenges and Missions
We meet a lot of people every day. 
We meet people at schools. 
We meet people at work. 
We meet people at parties.

**The majority of the people becomes our acquaintances. We say hello to them when we occasionally bump into each other. But how much do we actually know about them? **

**We are building a place to share these stories. And these stories has the power to turn an acquaintances into friends.**
